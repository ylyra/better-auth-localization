# better-auth-localization

## 2.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Providing custom translations no longer override the whole translation for used language
  Before when providing a custom translation for a specific error code, the whole translation for the language was overridden.

  ```typescript
  localization({
    defaultLocale: "pt-BR",
    translations: {
      "pt-BR": {
        USER_NOT_FOUND: "Usuário não encontrado",
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  If any other error code happened, it would fallback to the default translation due to the code missing from the custom translation. Now it will just use the default translation.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Now translations index is automatically generated on build through the generate-translations-index.cjs script, this was done to avoid manually updating the translations index file which was generating merge conflicts.
  This is a breaking change when adding new translations from now on, as we now need to export a LOCALES object from the translation file.

  ```ts
  export const LOCALES = {
    "pt-BR": PT_BR,
    "pt-PT": PT_PT,
  } as const;
  ```

  To generate the translations index locally for testing purposes, run:

  ```bash
  pnpm generate:translations
  ```
